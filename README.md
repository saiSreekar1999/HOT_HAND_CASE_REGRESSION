# HOT_HAND_CASE_REGRESSION
The case study titled "The Case of the Hot Hand" explores the concept of a "hot hand" in basketball, where a player is believed to have a higher probability of scoring after making several shots in succession. The study involves analyzing NBA data from the 2012/2013 season to develop regression models that relate various performance metrics to player salaries and to test the hot hand hypothesis. Using Python, the analysis includes creating histograms, scatter plots, and conducting multiple regression analyses with different combinations of predictors such as Age, FG, RB, AST, STL, BLK, and PTS. Transformations like log-scaling of salaries are employed to improve model fit. Additionally, the study conducts hypothesis testing using conditional probabilities and streaks of successful shots to examine if a hot hand effect is statistically significant. The analysis also extends to comparing basketball and baseball data, discussing the implications of findings on the belief in the hot hand phenomenon.
